# Phelel

A code that provides a few computations related to electron-phonon interaction
calculation in finite-displacement method reported by

Laurent Chaput, Atsushi Togo, and Isao Tanaka, Phys. Rev. B **100**, 174304
(2019).

Note that this code couples with VASP code, and the electron-phonon interaction
properties can not be computed only using this code.
