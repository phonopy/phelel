# PbTe example

Conventional unit cell of rocksalt-type PbTe crystal structure is stored in
`POSCAR-unitcell`. This structure is relaxed with 400 eV cutoff energy and
PBEsol XC functional. More detail of the relaxation calculation is found in
`velph-tmpl.toml`.

2x2x2 supercell of the unit cell and the supercells with displacements are
generated by

```
% phelel -d --dim 2 2 2 -c POSCAR-unitcell --pa auto --pm
```

By this command, following files are created. `phelel_disp.yaml` contains
crystal structure information and `SPOSCAR`, `POSCAR-001`, `POSCAR-002`,
`POSCAR-003`, `POSCAR-004` files are the perfect supercell and supercells with
four different displacements, respectively.

Let's assume that these supercell calculations are executed in `disp-000`,
`disp-001`, `disp-002`, `disp-003`, and `disp-004`. After the VASP calculations
(`LWAP=.TRUE.` or `ELPH_PREPARE=.TRUE.` in `INCAR` is necessary), phelel
computes derivatives of local potential and PAW strengths with respect to
displacements by

```
% phelel --cd disp-{000..004}
```

The result is stored in `phelel_params.hdf5`.
